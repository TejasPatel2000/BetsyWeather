# The file attached was a created file using a platform called PuTTY.
# PuTTY connects to AWS using the ipv4 and then put the source code in a file and called it
# using nodejs 6.10. other npms were also installed to help display the output(i.e. npm express)
# After doing this I created an amazon bucket and in the static hosting, I redirect it to the ipv4 that was called in the beginning.
# to get the forecast information simply enter "node index.js" into the terminal
# To get the output you must open up the terminal and cd into the directory.
# From there if you call node index.js and then go to the website(attached below last line), the desired output will show up in the terminal window.
# To access the code you may also need access to the key which will be attached in the email.
