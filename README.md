# The file attached was a created file using a platform called PuTTY.
# PuTTY connects to AWS using the ipv4 and then put the source code in a file and called it
# using nodejs 6.10.
# After doing this I created an amazon bucket and in the static hosting, I redirect it to the ipv4 that was called in the beginning.
# to get the forecast information simply enter "node index.js" into the terminal
